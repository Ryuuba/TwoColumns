This is a brief guide to write a report in Spanish. Official colors of UAM campuses are available in this template. The default color is blue (Xochimilco). The bibliography style is IEEEtran. All elements have been translated from English to Spanish. All settings are contained in 'pleamble.tex'. The project may easily build by means of latexmk. Compilation settings are stated in the file '.latexmk'. If you upload this project to an online platform, then delete the file '.latexmk' since it is not necessary. Once the project has been built, the output file is stored in Temp. The output file can be renamed is you change the name of the file 'main.tex'. If you do that, change line number four to indicate the name of the new main file.
